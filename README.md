**Database setup can (sql found in db/migrations)**
1. Create production database by running 01_create_makers_bnb_database.sql
2. Create test database by running 02_create_makers_bnb_test_database.sql
3. Add tables in both databases by running 03_add_users_table.sql, 04_add_spaces_table.sql and 05_add_bookings_table.sql

**Headline specifications**
1. Any signed-up user can list a new space.
2. Users can list multiple spaces.
3. Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
4. Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
6. Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
7. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

**Nice-to-haves**

    -- They sign up

    -- They create a space

    -- They update a space

    -- A user requests to book their space

    -- They confirm a request

    -- They request to book a space

    -- Their request to book a space is confirmed

9. Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:

    -- A user requests to book their space

    -- Basic payment implementation though Stripe

**User Stories**

Create Database (Update README on databse setup guide)

Set up MVC

Can create user that signs in (same sign up form for landlord and normal user)

User can sign in and get to spaces

#Main page for spaces (all spaces shown on one big page for MVP option)
*As a user
*So that I can look at all spaces
*I would like to see a list of spaces

Can add a apace to the page (only if user_type == landlord)

Check space availability by checking if there is a booking for the room on that date in database. (MVP monday/ tuesday etc), show on it's own view page what days the soace is booked.

New form for user to book soaces, this records on the database that space is taken.
